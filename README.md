# Bike Demand Prediction using Linear Regression - README

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Linear Regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various factors. The goal is to help BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing service, understand how different variables impact bike demand, particularly in the context of recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature scaling to normalize the dataset.
- **Feature Selection**: Utilized feature engineering techniques to identify the most relevant features and reduce multicollinearity.
- **Model Development**: Developed and trained a Linear Regression model to predict daily bike demand.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated model performance using metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and cross-validation.
  
## How to Run the Project

1. **Requirements**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - Required libraries: 
     - pandas
     - numpy
     - scikit-learn
     - matplotlib
     - seaborn

2. **Instructions**:
   - Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
   - Install the required dependencies using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
     ```
   - Open the Jupyter notebook `Bike_Demand_Prediction_Linear_Regression.ipynb` in your Jupyter environment.
   - Execute the notebook cells step-by-step to view data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation results.

## Project Structure

- **`Bike_Demand_Prediction_Linear_Regression.ipynb`**: The Jupyter notebook containing code for data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.
- **Data**: Load the dataset relevant to this project. Ensure the dataset is available before executing the notebook.

## Model Evaluation Metrics

- **R-squared**: Measures the percentage of variance explained by the model.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensures the model generalizes well on unseen data by partitioning the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Results and Insights

- The linear regression model demonstrated strong predictive performance with an R-squared value of over 90%.
- Model optimization via feature scaling and multicollinearity handling significantly improved the predictive power.
- Cross-validation provided further confidence in the model's generalization ability, reducing overfitting.

## Future Improvements

- Investigate the use of regularization techniques such as Ridge and Lasso regression to further improve model robustness.
- Experiment with additional feature selection techniques to refine the dataset and enhance model performance.
